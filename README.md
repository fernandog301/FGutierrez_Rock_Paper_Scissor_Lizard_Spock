Description: making a Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock game using a cpu and also lots of functions to make the game work.
Peer review by: Jerrod Packard
Peer review desc: I wasn't able to get the game to run at all. I think console errors from your javascript are keeping the game from working. Your design is nice though, I think it looks cool. I see you were trying to use show/hide to manage your game elements to simulate different game screens, but it seems like all of the elements are visible by default. I don't see any event listeners on your buttons inside your javascript file. You will definitely want to add those to make the game work. Inside your event listeners you can call your functions and set values for the user inputs to pass into your game functions.
